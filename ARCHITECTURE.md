# 🌌 Omni: The Federation Governance Tricorder

**Version:** 0.5.0 (The Unification)
**Status:** Living
**Document Type:** Blueprint
**Constitutional Authority:** Charter V1.1

---

## 📖 The Six Genesis Questions

### 1. What does this do?
> Omni provides a unified Command Line Interface (CLI) to **scan, map, and audit** the Seraphina Federation ecosystem. It bridges the gap between the "Ideal Truth" (Registry) and "Physical Reality" (Filesystem).

### 2. Why does it exist?
> The Federation grew too complex for manual governance. We needed a "Tricorder"—a tool that could instantly assess the health, structure, and compliance of the ecosystem without manual toil.

### 3. What must never change?
> **The Registry is God.** Omni does not invent truth; it reads the Registry. If the code differs from the Registry, the code is wrong (or the Registry needs updating). We prioritize canonical identity (UUIDs) over transient file paths.

### 4. What did we learn building it?
> That "Tools" tend to sprawl. By unifying them into a single `omni` package, we enforce hygiene and maintainability.

## II. The Declarative Intent (Λ)

### Primary Objective
To act as the **eyes and ears** of the System, providing real-time telemetry on:
1.  **Identity:** UUID Provenance (UPI).
2.  **Geography:** Ecosystem Maps (Cartography).
3.  **Resources:** Dependency Chains (Requirements).

```

## III. The Resilience Framework (Ψ)

### Dependencies
*   **Consumes**: `PROJECT_REGISTRY_MASTER.md` (Read-only)
*   **Provides**: Telemetry for `The Architect` and `Oracle`.

### Preservation Requirements
*   **Must Survive Resurrection**: The logic for interpreting the Registry must always match the Registry schema.
*   **Can Be Regenerated**: All artifacts in `artifacts/omni` are ephemeral and can be regenerated by running `omni audit`.

## IV. The Emergent Cosmos (Ω)

### Summary of Manifestation
Omni is now the central nervous system for Federation governance. It turns static files into a living, queryable knowledge graph.
