# Omni Roadmap

## Phase 1: Unification (Complete) ✅
- Consolidate all Python tools into `omni` package.
- Clean up `Infrastructure/tools` root.
- Establish `artifacts/omni` as standard output location.

## Phase 2: Constitutional Intelligence (Current) 🚧
- **Law & Lore Checker**: Scan READMEs for compliance with `LAW_LORE.md`.
- **Identity Enforcement**: `gate` command should fail builds if new Orphan UUIDs are introduced.
- **Agent Profiling**: `map` command should classify agents by archetype (Scribe, Vanguard, Sentinel).

## Phase 3: The Gamified Backend 🔮
- **Boss Rush Support**: Expose API for external gamification UI.
- **Quest Tracking**: Parse "Quest" markers in markdown files.
- **Achievement System**: Calculate metrics for visual badges.

## Phase 4: Azure Quantum Integration 🌌
- **Octad Mapping**: Visualize the 8-dimensional project structure.
- **Consciousness Bridge**: Real-time telemetry from active agents.
